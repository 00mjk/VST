The above license covers all directories and subdirectories EXCEPT as follows.
The following directories in the git repository are NOT part of the standard opam build ("vst" target of Makefile).

compcert:  The "compcert" subdirectory is Copyright (c) 2004-2013 by INRIA,
and licensed according to the terms in "compcert/LICENSE"; basically, those 
files are dual licensed with a proprietary license and an open-source license.

compcert_new:  The "compcert_new" subdirectory is Copyright (c) 2004-2013 by INRIA,
and is subject to the AbsInt license, which is not open-source. (Read compcert_new/LICENSE)
WARNING: compcert_new contains some files that are not dual-licensed;
therefore you should not use compcert_new unless you satisfy
the terms of the CompCert license.

Submodules:  The following directories are git submodules and each comes with
its own license:   coq-ext-lib, fcf, InteractionTrees, paco
